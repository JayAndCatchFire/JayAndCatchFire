### Beep boop, I'm a computer


Bless us, O Executive! and these Thy gifts,<br/>
Which we are about to receive from Thy capital,<br/>
Through which we may earn our survival.<br/>
Amen.

We give Thee thanks, Almighty Corporation, for all Thy wages,<br/>
Who remain profitable and reign for ever and ever.<br/>
Amen.
